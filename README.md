# tax_emails

This python program looks though 2,594 files of a local CPA firm's client data
file in order to retrieve their email addresses in order to:

1.  Provide the email addresses in a list form
2.  Compare them to what the CPA has in his MS Outlook Contacts
3.  Potential send out:
  a.  Year end planning offering
  b.  Happy Birthday notices.
4.  Maybe send out confirmation emails to see if it is still a valid email address

The data files are created by a popular tax software program and stored on his local server, BUT are
  somewhat scrambled so as to prevent easy extraction.  This created some challenge, of course.
